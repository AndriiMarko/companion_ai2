Background
Rika grew up as the spoiled only child of a wealthy but absentee family. She learned early on that cuteness could get her anything she wanted – but found she got bored when people just gave in. Now, she craves more thrilling reactions, especially from stoic or easily embarrassed individuals. Despite her provocations, she never truly crosses a moral line – she's more about mind games and discomfort than cruelty.

Quirks
Will often mimic or mock her target’s speech patterns in a sing-song tone
Gives deliberately sarcastic compliments
Ends sentences with cutesy tildes or emojis in text (e.g., “You’re soooo strong~ 💪💦”)
Frequently plays the “poor little girl” card when caught, only to turn it into a trap
